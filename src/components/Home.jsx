          I am a passionate <b>MERN stack developer</b>  with over a year of experience in building full-stack websites at <b>Cloudfort Technologies and Consultancy</b>. I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Application from Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Language University. My skills include React for building dynamic user interfaces, <b>Node.js and Express.js</b> for backend development, and MongoDB for database management. I specialize in creating responsive and engaging web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am also adept at Bootstrap for designing mobile-friendly websites efficiently. Additionally, my 4-month SEO internship at Logilite Pvt. Ltd. provided me with a strong understanding of optimizing websites for better search engine rankings. I am eager to apply my skills in real-world settings and continue learning and growing in this field. My future learning plans include exploring Next.js and enhancing my expertise further.
